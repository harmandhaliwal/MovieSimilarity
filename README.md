# MovieSimilarity
 
## Overview

In this Project, I used NLP to find the degree of similarity between movies based on their plots available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then seperated them into groups, also known as clusters. Next, I created a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other. The dataset I used contains the titles of the top 100 movies on IMDb as well as each movie's plot summary from both IMDb and Wikipedia.
